# Attention! LXDoNe Released!
This addon won't be supported anymore. We are moving forward to a fresh new add-on to manage LXD containers from Opennebula.  You can move forward to [here] (https://github.com/OpenNebula/addon-lxdone) ... WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND IT! :)

# Addon LXCoNe

## Description

This addon gives Opennebula the posibility to manage LXC 
containers. It includes virtualization and monitoring drivers.

This is the readme for the current development version. If you're looking for one of the stable releases, check the [releases] (https://github.com/OpenNebula/addon-lxcone/releases) at the top of this page.


## Features

This addon has the following capabilities:

* Deploy, stop, shutdown, reboot, save, suspend and resume LXC containers.
* Supports File-System, LVM and CEPH datastores.
* It's able to hot-attach and detach NICs and Disks from all the datastores specified before.
* Failure probe. In case any node is forcibly power off, or in case of an electrical failure, all containers that where running inside affected nodes will be up and running once the node is started again, and all hard drives and NICs attached and hot-attached will be in the same state they were. Only running containers will be started, the ones that where in power off state will stay the same. The only condition is that the frontend must be up before nodes are started, and /var/lib/one must be specified with the auto option inside fstab (step 2.4 from the Guide).
* VM snaphots, only for containers with File-System disks attached.
* Obtain monitoring information from nodes and containers.
* Limit container's resources. In this moment, we are only able to limit RAM memory. CPU limit is not yet supported.
